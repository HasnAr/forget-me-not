# Forget Me Not - Mock Press Release #

There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  Forget Me Not

## Sub-Heading ##
  
  A fun tool for remembering your students' names through stories!  

## Summary ##
  
  Forget Me Not is a simple, story-based tool that lets you create your own personalized hints and form stronger mental connections between a student and their name.

## Problem ##
  
  The most effective learning environments are personal and accountable. When you don't know a student's name or, even worse, call them by the wrong name, you risk making the student feel anonymous, undermining accountability.   

## Solution ##
  
  Unlike traditional memory apps, Forget Me Not is built on scientific evidence that you are far more likely to retain a piece of information that you learn through a story than you would through rote memorization. The Forget Me Not interface is designed to help you create, store and access your own personal stories (or hints) about each student, which will help you form a "sticky" connection between a student's photo and their name. 
  
## Quote from You ##
  
  "Forget Me Not is a scientifically proven way to remember your students' names, and it's fun, too!"

## How to Get Started ##

  All you have to do is upload your students' photos and names to the site (alternately, each student may upload their own photos and names to a shared collection). Then, click "START" to initiate a new round! 

  You'll see a student's photo and a field to enter their name. If you enter the name incorrectly, you'll see a field to create and save a short story that will help you connect their name to their photo. The next time that particular student appears, just click on the "HINT" button to see your story.

## Customer Quote ##
  
  "Using Forget Me Not for 15 minutes before my lectures has totally transformed my teaching! No more guessing or apologizing for forgetting students' names -- now I can just focus on teaching!"
